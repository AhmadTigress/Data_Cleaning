# Data_Cleaning
This repository provides hands-on exercises, Python scripts, and techniques for data cleaning, including handling missing data, scaling, parsing dates, encoding, and fixing inconsistencies.


# Kaggle Data Cleaning Course

Welcome to the **Kaggle Data Cleaning Course** repository! This project is focused on teaching data cleaning techniques using real-world datasets, enhancing skills in data preprocessing for machine learning and data analysis.

## Course Outline

The course is structured into the following modules:

1. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Techniques for handling missing or null values in datasets.
   - Methods: Imputation (mean, median, mode), forward/backward filling, and dropping missing values.

2. **Scaling and Normalization**
   - How to scale or normalize your data for machine learning models.
   - Techniques: Min-Max scaling, Standardization (Z-score), and Robust scaling.

3. **Parsing Dates**
   - Converting date/time columns to proper datetime formats for analysis.
   - Handling different date formats and extracting relevant information (e.g., year, month, day).

4. **Character Encoding**
   - Encoding categorical data for machine learning models.
   - Techniques: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and dealing with text features.

5. **Inconsistent Data Entry**
   - Identifying and resolving inconsistencies in data entries.
   - Methods: Standardizing text entries (e.g., “Yes” vs “yes”), correcting typos, and ensuring consistent formats.

## Data Description

The datasets used throughout this course are hosted on **Kaggle** and are now uploaded in this repository for easy access. These datasets cover various domains, including healthcare, finance, and retail.

- **Dataset 1**: Description of dataset 1.
- **Dataset 2**: Description of dataset 2.

Make sure to download them from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or from this repository, depending on where they’re hosted.

## Python Files and Exercises

In addition to the Jupyter notebooks, this repository contains Python scripts and exercises designed to reinforce key data cleaning concepts.

- **Python Scripts**: These scripts provide hands-on examples of data cleaning techniques using Pandas, NumPy, and other libraries.
- **Exercises**: After completing each module, work through the provided exercises to practice the concepts learned.
